# A Python Implementation of Route Planner between 2 Cities using A-Star Search Algorithm 

In this Project A-Star Search algorithm has been used to to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm to find the optimal path to commute from a partcular city to destination (target) city.

The map above shows a network of roads which spans 40 different intersections (labeled 0 through 39).

# Result Showcase : In the Map below the starting city node is colored as Yellow and the destination city the vehicle needs to reach is displayed as Black Colored Node . The Path / Route which got selected by the vehicle to reach the destination is highlighted by the Red Nodes i.e. the intermediate cities between the starting city and the target (destination) city the vehicle chose to pass through using the A Star Search Algorithm
