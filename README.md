# Trajectory Reconstruction from Raw Sensor Data of Vehicle Odometer

Given a set of raw sensor data collected by the readings of Odometer of a Vehicle containing the values of below mentioned 4 parameters

1) timestamp - Timestamps are all measured in seconds. The time between successive timestamps ( Î”t ) will always be the same within a trajectory's data set (but not between data sets).

2) displacement - Displacement data from the odometer is in meters and gives the total distance traveled up to this point.

3) yaw_rate - Yaw rate is measured in radians per second with the convention that positive yaw corresponds to counter-clockwise rotation.

4) acceleration - Acceleration is measured in  m/ss  and is always in the direction of motion of the vehicle (forward).

After processing of the above provided Sensor data of Vehicle's Motion exact trajectory of the vehicle is reconstructed by plotting a graph of vehicle's X and Y position

# Inference derived from the plotted graph of vehicle trajectory

This vehicle first accelerates forwards and then turns right until it almost completes a full circle turn.
