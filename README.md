# Trajectory Reconstruction from Raw Sensor Data of Vehicle Odometer

Given a set of raw sensor data collected by the readings of Odometer of a Vehicle containing the values of below mentioned 4 parameters

1) timestamp - Timestamps are all measured in seconds. The time between successive timestamps ( Î”t ) will always be the same within a trajectory's data set (but not between data sets).

2) displacement - Displacement data from the odometer is in meters and gives the total distance traveled up to this point.

3) yaw_rate - Yaw rate is measured in radians per second with the convention that positive yaw corresponds to counter-clockwise rotation.

4) acceleration - Acceleration is measured in  m/ss  and is always in the direction of motion of the vehicle (forward).
