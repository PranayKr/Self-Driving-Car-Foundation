# 2-D Histogram Filter Implementation in Python 

Implented code to show how a Robot moving in a 2-D world localizes itself by gathering the data from its sensors and then moving to a new location in the 2-D grid and then again collecting data from its sensors about its new location and moving again in an iterative loop for a given number of time-steps . 

By sensing its environment and then moving in a recursive loop the robot is able to estimate its position i.e. loclaize itself with respect to the world it is moving in
